# Bright-Coffee-Sales-Case-Study

📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes daily transaction data from Bright Coffee Shop to uncover actionable insights that support the new CEO’s mission to grow revenue and improve product performance.  

The dataset, titled `Bright_Coffee_Shop_Sales.xlsx`, captures key business metrics such as:
- Transaction date and time  
- Day and month classification  
- Store location  
- Product category and type  
- Unit price, quantity sold, and revenue  

As a "Junior Data Analyst", my goal is to use this data to:
1. Identify top-performing products and categories.  
2. Understand customer buying patterns and peak sales periods.  
3. Provide recommendations that can help drive strategic decisions.


 📊 Data Analysis & Pivot Insights

 1️⃣ Total Revenue per Product Type
- **Top Performers:** Brewed Chai Tea, Gourmet Brewed Coffee, Barnstable Espresso.  
- **Low Performers:** Premium Brewed Coffee, Drip Coffee.  
- These top 3 products generate nearly **45% of total revenue**.

**Recommendation:**  
Promote top drinks as “Signature Favorites” and repackage low performers in bundles or special offers.


### 2️⃣ Peak Time Intervals for Sales
- Peak sales occur during **7–10 AM** and **2–4 PM**.  
- Evenings show the lowest customer traffic.

**Recommendation:**  
Increase staff during morning and afternoon rush hours.  
Launch “Afternoon Boost” specials to grow off-peak sales.


### 3️⃣ Quantity of Items Sold by Product Category
- **Hot Beverages** dominate total sales volume.  
- **Snacks** like scones are steady sellers.

**Recommendation:**  
Cross-sell snacks with beverages (e.g., “Add a scone for R10”).  
Introduce combo deals to increase basket size.


### 4️⃣ Best-Selling Product Types or Details
- Top 5 products are mostly **coffee and chai-based** drinks.  
- Other teas have lower demand.

**Recommendation:**
